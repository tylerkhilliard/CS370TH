In this project, design an intelligent agent for the solution to a pathfinding problem using various techniques of reinforcement learning. Originally, I was given a basic framework with setup for the environment and some predefined functions for state representation and basic maze navigation. From here, implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm gave me deep Q-learning. It designed a neural network to approximate Q-values for state–action pairs and added the concept of experience replay to increase learning efficiency. In addition, I implemented the epsilon-greedy strategy to balance between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, I wrote the code for the training loop, updating the Q-network in accordance with environment feedback, and put in logic that updates the target network periodically to stabilize training.
Computer scientists design solutions for complex problems using computation, develop algorithms, design software, and develop systems for the efficient, accurate processing of information. The importance of this field lies in the fact that it gives way to technology advancement on all aspects of modern life: health, finances, education, entertainment, and many more. Computer science innovates—the products of which are medical technologies that save lives, secure financial transactions, education at one's fingertips, or digital experiences engaging and full of delight. A computer science approach to problems means, therefore, understanding the problem, researching, designing solutions, coding, testing, optimization, and ensuring that the solution is maintainable and scalable. Some major ethical responsibilities include ensuring privacy and security, fairness and non-discrimination, reliability and safety, transparency and accountability, sustainability, and professionalism toward the end user and the organization. Following these principles in their work, technology developers in computer science help build technologies that can be trusted, reliable, and fair for society.
